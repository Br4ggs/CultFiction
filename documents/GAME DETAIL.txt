Game will be based on this snippet:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLCTSMBUfmE


*STORY*
You are in your apartment, you sell pot for a living and you do this by selling to those who call you up and ask for some of your "supply".
Carefull though, stoners aren't the only ones looking out for someone selling, narcs have started to go undercover and act like
your usual clients who want some dope, though their intentions are much less fortunate for you...


*GAMEPLAY*
The player will be sitting in his/her apartment, when they will get a phone call, which they will have to answer.
This first call will be your friend explaining how the game works. (see MECHANICS for more info)

After that, the player will get a constant stream of phone calls.
The player will then have the choice of either selling pot, or denying having pot to the caller.
The player will have to base this decision off of the conversation they just had with
the person, using key words, vocabulary usage and sentence structuring from their dialog.

The player can also choose to get high themselves, this gives them more points,
but will make it more difficult to distinguish who's a narc and who's not. (see MECHANICS info)

The player will lose if they keep too many calls hanging, or if they sell to a narc.
In adition, if the timer mechanic is implemented (see MECHANICS for more info), the player will also be able to lose by not accumulating
enough money at the end of the evening.

The player can win with the timer mechanic if they manage to get the required amount of money at the end of the evening.
otherwise it will be an endless game.
